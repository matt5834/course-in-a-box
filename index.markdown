## A Progressive Approach to Helping Every Student Compose Music

It is a wonderful time to be a music educator!

Technology can transform any music classroom into a place where every student regardless of background or experience can make creative choices about how they'd like to make their own music sound. In so doing they gain skills and learn concepts that aid in their understanding of how music works. A learner who is given this opportunity becomes indepenent and can begin to use music as a unique form of expresssion.  

## Just like art class.
In the typical visual art class every student begins some kind or creative project (a drawing, painting, sculpture etc.) probably from the very first class. 
		
## OK, but who are you guys?

We're [Peer 2 Peer University](http://p2pu.org)--we build learning communities
on the web. In the last 5 years, we put together courses like 
[Play With Your Music](http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/),
[Learning Creative Learning](http://learn.media.mit.edu/lcl/), the
[Deeper Learning MOOC](http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/), and
[A Gentle Intro to Python](http://mechanicalmooc.org/). 
Also, we're a non-profit and a distributed team (so we use the tools we recommend).
