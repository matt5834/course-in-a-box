## A Progressive Approach to Helping Every Student Compose Music

The world of music education is 

In a stellar learning experience, you'd know who was in the room and feel super-comfy.
You'd make projects together and find help when you get stuck. You'd want to send people
thank-you cards and chicken soup.

We know designing a creative, participatory community can be tricky. We're here to help
you craft assignments that rule, build an audience and support you along the way. You'll
even learn a few technical skills in the process. Don't worry, 1s and 0s wash off
pretty easily.
		
## OK, but who are you guys?

We're [Peer 2 Peer University](http://p2pu.org)--we build learning communities
on the web. In the last 5 years, we put together courses like 
[Play With Your Music](http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/),
[Learning Creative Learning](http://learn.media.mit.edu/lcl/), the
[Deeper Learning MOOC](http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/), and
[A Gentle Intro to Python](http://mechanicalmooc.org/). 
Also, we're a non-profit and a distributed team (so we use the tools we recommend).
