## A Progressive Approach to Helping Every Student Compose Music

It is a wonderful time to be a music educator!

Technology can transform any music classroom into a place where every student regardless of background or experience can make creative choices about how they'd like to make their own music sound. In so doing they gain skills and learn concepts that aid in their understanding of how music works. A learner who is given this opportunity becomes indepenent and can begin to use music as a unique form of expresssion. 

## Just like art class: Sound before Theory
In the typical visual art class every student begins some kind or creative project (a drawing, painting, sculpture etc.) from the very first class. There is no need for the young learner to develop a facility or technique *before* beginning an art project. They devlop those skills through *doing* the project! So too is this true for the young music learner. 

## Composition vs. Performance (or Both!)
Music teachers have always used strategies that foster creativity and make room for student voice. Through improvisation with pitched percussion, the voice or band instruments students can explore how music works through *performing.* There is now a deeper and more creative way for students to express themselves through music.  With technology like [Noteflight](http://www.noteflight.com) students can explore every aspect of the musical language as well as performance practice techniques by composing their own pieces for others to perform. Best of all students can also develop their own performance skills by writing a part for themselves to play. **Throughout this course we will examine methods that help students compose music by both performing it first or composing it first.**
