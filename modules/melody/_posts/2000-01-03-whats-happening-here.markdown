#What's Happening Here?

Did you notice what didn't happen? 

There was was no discussion of or exercises about music theory whatsoever. There may come a time when a theoretical explanation is necessary but we believe that it shouldn't be at the beginning. Students can manipulate Noteflight to make the music sound the way they want. The feedback they receive about the choices they make will help them make future choices.

Also there were no preliminary activities about how to use Noteflight. We've created the early lessons as a way for students to jump right in and have early successes.
