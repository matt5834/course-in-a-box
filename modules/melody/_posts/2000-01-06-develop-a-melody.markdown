#Repetition
Repetition is perhaps the most important concept for the young composer to grasp. Think of your favorite song. Take note
the many ways that repetition is important to that piece. It could be small scale repetition like the way melodic phrases repeat or
it could be large scale repetition having to do with the overall form.

#Create Your Main Melody!
Before you can develop a melody you need to create one!  Compose a main melody for you composition. Think of it as the main character in your story. Throughout your story this character will appear in different ways and in different contexts.

##Develop Your Main Melody- 3 Kinds of Repetition

Ok, now that you have a main melody that you really love I'm sure your listeners would like to hear it again. There are three ways you could develop your melody:


**Exact Repetition:**  Of course you could always just repeat it exactly as you have it. This is fine to do but it may be the least interesting option. 

**Variation:** Try repeating your melody but making some kind of change to it. Another way to think of this is having something new in your piece that is related in some way to something we've already heard. You could:


1. End on a different note the second time

2. Begin the melody differently the second time

3. Change the melodic shape slightly somewhere in your melody. 


##Try a Sequence
A sequence is a kind of repetition also. Choose part of your main melody or even the entire melody. Repeat that exact same melodic shape but from a higher or lower starting note. For example:

#Go to your main melody and develop it!
Where is it?  Well, remember that any time you open a template score it is automatically saved for you in your Noteflight home. Find the score called Composition 1 in your Noteflight home. This will be the score used for your main composition.
