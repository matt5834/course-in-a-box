##Home Note
Did you use any sharps or flats in the melody you created?  Did you end on the note C?

Having a sense of key helps a melody be memorable and singable. One way to give a melody a strong sense of key is to end on the home note (in this case C).

Complete this Noteflight assignment to practice ending a melody on the home note C.

##Sharps or Flats
Often a student will add sharps or flats to her melody. When this happens investigate if they are doing it because they hear some note other than C as the home note. If so, this would be a great moment to talk to them about key signature. If they are randomly adding sharps or flats though it may be useful to help them hear that the sharps or flats take their melody outside of the C "Do-Re-Mi" scale. 
Practice working with accidentals:
