###Why Articulations
Imagining how you'd like the musicians to play your work is part of the fun of composing music! The more detailed you can make the instructions for how the musicians should play the notes the more closely the performance will match your imagination.  **Articulations**  refer to how the notes are played. Let's start with the basics. 


###Slurs
Slurs are lines placed above or below the notes that tell the musician to play those notes smooth and connected.
