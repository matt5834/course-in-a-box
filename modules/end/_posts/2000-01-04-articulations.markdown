###Why Articulations
Imagining how you'd like the musicians to play your work is part of the fun of composing music! The more detailed you can make the instructions for how the musicians should play the notes the more closely the performance will match your imagination.  **Articulations**  refer to how the notes are played. Let's start with the basics. 


###Staccato 
A dot placed directly above or below the note tells the musician to play that note short and seperate. (This is a differente symbol from teh **rhythm dot.**)




###Slurs
Slurs are lines placed above or below the notes that tell the musician to play those notes smooth and connected.

###Accents
A really neat rhythmic effect to try is making certain notes slightly louder, or accented than other notes. This symbol is called an accent. Accents can be used any where. Think of how or why you accent certain words or syllables when you speak. You may want to accent certain notes in your melodies for the same reason!



###Combine Articulations
Combining articulations can have a dramatic effect. Listen to this example and notice how each articulation changes the way the notes sound.
