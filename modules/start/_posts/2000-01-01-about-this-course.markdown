## How will this course work?

![Image of cole]({{site.baseurl}}/img/cole.png)

This course is designed to help teachers explore the process of bringing music composition to your classroom for **all** of your students. You'll create your own composition using the Young Composers & Improvisors Workshop curriculum just as your students will. Along the way you will take part in conversation and feedback to help gain insights into how best to implement the curriculum and explore some of the challenges that often arise. Best of all, you will have an opportunity to share your ideas and expertise for improving the process! 

## When should I take this course?

###Take It Anytime!
Feel free to take this course anytime.  

###Take it While You are Teaching Your Students!
Much of the feedback and support from other teachers will be invaluable while you are working with your students. Think of this course as your own support system for implementing the YCIW curriculum. You'll also want to share your own thoughts and experiences about each lesson as you are teaching them. What worked? What was challenging? What did you discover? etc.
