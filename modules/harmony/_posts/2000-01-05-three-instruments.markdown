##Three Instruments

We can compose the majority of our piece with three instruments only. Even if we end up with a total of 6 instruments it might be best to compose only for 3 instruments so that we can keep track of the harmonic structure.

1. Complete the music for the two instruments in your composition. Be sure that you have properly controlled all of the dissonances and have clear textures. One of your instruments should be the "star" - the main melody. 
2. Add a third instrument to your composition (Go to Staff menu "Add Part Below Staff").
3. Copy the instrument that is the background part and paste it into the new third staff.
