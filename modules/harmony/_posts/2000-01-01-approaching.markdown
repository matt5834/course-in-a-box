##Consonance and Dissonance
Putting harmony into a broad context can help give young composers a way to organize consonant intervals as well as resolve dissonant intervals.


What do we mean by a broad definition of harmony?

Harmony = any two sounds ocurring at the same time. 


As you know, the idea of what two notes sound consonant or dissonant together is a subjective preference.  Since the beginning of human history composers have pushed the boundaries and expanded tonality. During the 20th century leading composers in many styles of music dispatched with the very notion of Western harmony to create their own rules governing the harmony in their music. Where does that lead us interms of present day harmony?  There are two things to consider when helping young composers grapple with the concept of consonance and dissonance in their music:

1. Younger students are primarily influenced by the most basic western idea of consonance and dissonance and want their own music to "sound good."
2. The most basic ear training for hearing tertiary harmony is a realistic, achievable first goal that can help students explore music around them. 

##Harmony Rule 1
To get students started in controlling dissonances in their piece we will use a contrived harmonic rule we'll call **Harmony Rule 1**  Don't worry this is going to be the only harmonic rule we'll use!

Harmony Rule 1 says:

###Letters a STEP apart in the musical aplphabet =  Dissonances

###Letters a SKIP apart in the musical alphabet = Consonances


This rule makes the subjective choice about steps and skips in the musical alphabet.  One important thing to note is that we need not discern between 1/2 steps and whole steps.  E to F is a step just as C to D is a step. We also need not discern between major and minor thirds. C to E is a skip and E to G is also a skip. **During a second or third composition students can explore "two kinds of steps" to explore 1/2 steps and whole steps.**
