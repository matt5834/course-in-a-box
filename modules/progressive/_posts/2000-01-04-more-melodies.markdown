##What about Rhythm?:

We have not made any mention of rhythm so far! The idea that a melody needs to be singable can help students make choices that are also playable by instruments. (Important later on!) As an experienced musician you likely composed your melody while simultaneously conceiving of the rhythm you wanted. Most young students will gain rhythmic fluency by experimenting with different rhythms in Notelfight and hearing them back.
