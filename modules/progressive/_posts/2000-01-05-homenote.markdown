#Home Note
Did you use any sharps or flats in the melody you created?  Did you end on the note C?

Having a sense of key helps a melody be memorable and singable. One way to give a melody a strong sense of key is to end on the home note (in this case C).

Complete this Noteflight assignment to practice ending a melody on the home note C.
